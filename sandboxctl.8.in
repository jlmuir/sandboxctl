.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates and manages chroot-based sandboxed environments in a portable manner
based on a simple configuration file.
.Pp
Because
.Xr chroot 8
is a privileged system command, you must be root to use this tool.
.Pp
The following options apply to all commands:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl c Ar config_name
Specifies the configuration file to use.
The format of the file is described in
.Xr sandboxctl.conf 5 .
.Pp
If
.Ar config_name
includes any directory separator (i.e. one or more slashes) or the
.Sq .conf
suffix, then the argument specifies the path to the configuration file.
.Pp
If
.Ar config_name
is a bare name without any directory components nor the extension, then the
configuration file will be looked up in
.Pa __SANDBOXCTL_ETCDIR__/<config_name>.conf .
The file must exist in this case.
.It Fl o Ar variable=value
Applies an override to the loaded configuration.
.Pp
The
.Ar variable
part of the argument must be any of the recognized configuration variables
described in
.Xr sandboxctl.conf 5 .
The
.Ar value ,
if not empty, specifies the value to set the configuration variable to.
If
.Ar value
is empty, then the configuration variable is unset.
.It Fl v
Enables verbose mode.
.El
.Ss Sandbox types
Sandboxes managed by
.Nm
have a type associated to them.
The sandbox type etermines how the sandbox is constructed and provides all the
operating system-specific knowledge to do so.
There is one or more sandbox types for every supported operating system.
.Pp
For example: on
.Nx ,
there is sandbox type to create an environment that reproduces the host system,
and there also is a sandbox type that recreates a fresh installation of the
system.
Sandbox types are described in
.Xr sandboxctl.conf 5
along with all the settings that affect their behavior.
.Ss Sandbox lifecycle
A sandbox managed by
.Nm
goes through these operations:
.Bl -enum
.It
.Em Configure :
The administrator sets up a configuration file to define the sandbox.
See
.Xr sandboxctl.conf 5
for details.
.It
.Em Create :
Prepares the on-disk layout but does not mount any file systems within it (which
may be necessary depending on the type of the sandbox).
This operation happens once per sandbox.
The sandbox is created with the
.Sq create
command.
.It
.Em Enter or mount :
Performs preparatory work to enter the sandbox, such as mounting any filesystems
within the sandbox or copying dynamic files.
This operation happens every time the sandbox is entered for interaction as
described in the next command.
.It
.Em Interact :
The administator can issue commands within the sandbox via the
.Sq run
command or open a shell via the
.Sq shell
command.
.It
.Em Leave or unmount :
Performs the opposite work of the
.Em Enter
step.
In particular, unmounts any file systems that may be left mounted in the
sandbox.
This operation happens every time the interaction step completes.
.It
.Em Destroy :
The on-disk layout for the sandbox is completely removed.
This operation cannot be executed while there is any active sandbox in the
.Em Interact
stage.
The sandbox is destroyed with the
.Sq destroy
command.
.El
.Pp
Note that sandbox entry/leave operations are reference-counted and can happen
concurrently.
.Nm
ensures that only the first concurrent interaction step executes the entry step
and that only the last concurrent interaction step executes the leave step.
.Ss The config command
The config command dumps the loaded configuration to the standard output.
The format of the output is not a script, so it cannot be fed back into
.Nm .
The purpose of this command is to aid in debugging the configuration of the
tool, particularly for those configuration files that use shell logic to
determine the value of the variables they define.
.Pp
Note that the output of this command varies across operating systems depending
on the sandbox types available.
.Ss The create command
Creates the sandbox, which must not yet exist.
.Ss The destroy command
Destroys the sandbox, which must exist and must not be active.
In other words, no other
.Nm
instance may be running the
.Sq run
or
.Sq shell
commmands.
.Ss The run command
Executes a given command inside the sandbox.
The sandbox must exist.
This operation always mounts the sandbox before running the command and unmounts
it after completion.
.Ss The shell command
Executes an interactive shell inside the sandbox.
The sandbox must exist.
This operation always mounts the sandbox before running the shell and unmounts
it after completion.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Pa __SANDBOXCTL_ETCDIR__/
Directory containing all system-wide configuration files.
.It Pa __SANDBOXCTL_ETCDIR__/default.conf
Default configuration file to load if the user does not specify any other.
